# Project Description-

In this Python project, we are going to build an exciting project through which you can check and even improve your typing speed. For a graphical UI, we are going to utilize the pygame library which is utilized for working with illustrations. Let begin-

      1. This project requires some knowledge on topics like Python, and some python libraries pygame, etc.
      2. Python - Python is easy to learn and work on with the language. It is an elevated level, broadly useful programming and profoundly intruded on language.
      3. Pygame- Pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language explicitly proposed to assist you with making games and other mixed media             applications. Based on the profoundly versatile SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) improvement library, pygame can stumble into numerous stages and working frameworks.
      4. Point to be noted, â€œProgrammers can explore different avenues regarding the programming language as shown by their comfort level and data" and can change the recently     referenced language according to them.
